# Step 1: Create the High Availability Network

## Tasks

- Fork Project Repo
- Clone Project Repo
- Create a **VPC**
- Create **4 Subnets**
  - Public Subnet A
  - Public Subnet B
  - Private Subnet A
  - Private Subnet B
- Create an **Internet Gateway**
- Create a **NAT Gateway**
- Configure Route Tables
  - Use the **Main Route Table** for Public Subnets.
  - Create a separate **Private Route Table**.
- Associate:
  - Public Subnets → Main Route Table
  - Private Subnets → Private Route Table
- Create the following Security Groups:
  - `public-sg`
  - `private-sg`
  - `loadbalancer-sg`

---

# Step 2: Create Amazon EFS

## Tasks

- Create an Amazon Elastic File System (EFS).
- Create Mount Targets.
- Attach the EFS to the required Availability Zones.
- Allow NFS traffic (TCP Port **2049**) between:
  - `private-sg`
  - `public-sg`
- Create an **EFS Access Point**.

---

# Step 3: Create a Datadog Account

## Tasks

1. Create a Datadog account.
2. Navigate to:

```
Infrastructure → Linux
```

1. Copy the Linux Agent installation command.
2. Save it for later use in the EC2 User Data script.

---

# Step 4: Create the Jump Server (Bastion Host)

## Tasks

- Launch a **t2.small** EC2 instance.
- Deploy it in a **Public Subnet**.
- Create an SSH Key Pair.
- Download the User Data script from:

```
https://github.com/digitalwitchdemo/Configuration_management.git
```

- Replace the Datadog variables with your own values.
- Paste the script into the EC2 **User Data** section.

---

# Step 5: Configure Slack Notifications

## Tasks

- Create a Slack Workspace.
- Create a Notification Channel.
- Integrate Datadog with Slack.
- Invite the Datadog App into the channel.

---

# Step 6: Configure Datadog Monitoring & Alerting

## Tasks

- Create a Notification Rule.
- Select the Slack Channel.
- Create a CPU Utilization Monitor.
- Attach the Notification Rule.
- Trigger a CPU spike.
- Verify Slack receives the alert.

---

# Step 7: Deploy the Web Application

## 7.1 Create a Launch Template

- Instance Type: **t2.small**
- Use the provided User Data script.
- Configure:
  - IAM Role
  - Security Group
  - Key Pair

---

## 7.2 Create an Auto Scaling Group

- Use the Launch Template.
- Deploy into the Private Subnets.
- Configure:
  - Minimum Capacity
  - Desired Capacity
  - Maximum Capacity

---

## 7.3 Create a Target Group

- Target Type: **Instance**
- Configure Health Checks.

---

## 7.4 Create an Application Load Balancer

Deploy into the Public Subnets.

Configure:

- Security Group
- HTTP Listener (Port 80)
- Target Group

Test:

```bash
http://<load-balancer-dns-name>
```

---

# Step 8: Configure Route 53 Hosted Zone

## Tasks

- Create a Public Hosted Zone.
- Copy the four AWS Name Servers.
- Login to Namecheap.
- Replace the Namecheap Name Servers with the AWS Name Servers.
- Create an Alias Record pointing to the Load Balancer.

Verify DNS resolution.

---

# Step 9: Configure HTTPS (SSL)

## Request Certificate

Open:

```
AWS Certificate Manager (ACM)
```

- Request a Public Certificate.
- Select your Domain.
- Create the required CNAME validation record.
- Wait until the certificate status changes to **Issued**.

---

## Configure HTTPS Listener

Go to the Load Balancer.

Create:

- HTTPS Listener (443)
- Attach the ACM Certificate.
- Route traffic to the Target Group.

Test:

```bash
https://your-domain.com
```

Once confirmed, either:

- Delete the HTTP Listener, or
- Configure HTTP → HTTPS Redirection.

---

# Step 10: Documentation & Defence Preparation

## Tasks

- Document every deployment step.
- Capture screenshots.
- Ensure every team member understands the deployment.
- Prepare for project defence.
- Be ready to explain every stage of the deployment.
